This folder contains a Jupyter notebook demo that I developed and presented as the first in a series of intern-led presentations/demos of new and emerging technologies to the Advanced Technology group at Southern California Edison (SCE)'s Grid Modernization Planning and Technology department. This was done in an effort to expose current engineers and colleagues at SCE of possible technologies that they could possibly use in their future studies and workflows. As the electric grid modernizes, so too do the tools used to maintain, analyze, and operate the grid need to modernize and this Jupyter notebook demo spearheaded a forum-like series of presentations led by interns to contribute to this effort.
