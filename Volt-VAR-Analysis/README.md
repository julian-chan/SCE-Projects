This repository contains the code that I developed as a 2017 summer intern for Southern California Edison's (SCE) Advanced Technology Group in Grid Modernization Planning & Technology (GMP&T).

This folder contains code that analyzes power, voltage and VAR (reactive power) data from January 1, 2016 - June 30, 2017. 

This folder contains Python code that incorporates the data analysis procedure in the IPython notebook into a graphical user interface created using Tkinter and generates a PDF summary report for loading conditions, VAR load, and voltage at specific substations.

The VBA Scripts/ folder contains Visual Basic for Applications code that performs an analysis on the voltage and VAR data in Excel spreadsheets and populates cells in the spreadsheet to report results.
