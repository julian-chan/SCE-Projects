# PV-Peak-Shift
This repository contains the code that I developed as a 2017 summer intern for Southern California Edison's (SCE) Advanced Technology Group in Grid Modernization Planning & Technology (GMP&T).

This folder contains code for analyzing load and photovoltaic (PV) generation as a time series, checking stationarity using the Dickey-Fuller Test, and applying an ARIMA model to forecast growth in system load and PV growth.
